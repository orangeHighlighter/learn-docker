Why use Docker?

Docker attempts to solve problem where by errors appear during software installation.

    For example, npm packages requiring certain node version etc. 

    Docker in a nut shell:
        On mac redis installation guide does not work simply by copy pasting https://redis.io/downloadc copy
            docker run -it redis on the other hand installs redis 

Takeaway: 
    Docker makes it really easy to install and run software without worrying about setup or dependencies.

What is Docker? 
    Docker is a platform containing a number of apps/tools(Docker Client, Server, Machine, Images, Hub, Compose)
     in its ecosystem for creating and running containers.

    Image:
        Single file with all the dependencies and configurations required to run a program.

    Container:
        An instance of an image (runs a program).

    When we ran 'docker run -it redis' the Docker CLI, reached out the Docker Hub and downloaded an image.

Docker for Mac/Windows:
    Docker Client:
        Also known as Docker Command Line Interface(CLI), is a tool we are going to use to issue commands to.

    Docker Server:
        Also known as a Docker Daemon, is a tool responsible for creating images, running containers, etc.

Mac OSX:
    1. Need to sign up for an account.
    2. Download docker for mac
    3. Docker ID publicly visible, install and login to Docker
        verify installation with docker version

    Windows has a similar installation guide.

    https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#prerequisites

        On all linux oss' must uninstall older versions of Docker
        
        For Ubuntu (which is what I am using)

            sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc

        Community package is now called docker-ce

            terminal installation commands:

                # Step 1
                sudo apt-get update
                
                # Step 2
                sudo apt-get install \
                apt-transport-https \
                ca-certificates \
                curl \
                gnupg-agent \
                software-properties-common

                # Step 3
                curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

                # Step 3
                sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88

                # Step 4 (bionic, x86_64)
                sudo add-apt-repository \
                "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
                $(lsb_release -cs) \
                stable"

                # Step 5
                sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

                # Step 6 verify installation
                sudo docker run hello-world

            next we need to install Docker Compose
                https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose

                # Step 1
                sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

                # Step 2
                sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

                # Step 3 verify installation
                docker-compose --version

            running docker without sudo
                https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user
                
                # Step 1
                sudo groupadd docker

                # Step 2 
                sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

                # Step 3
                newgrp docker 

                # Step 4 verify docker runs without sudo
                docker run hello-world

                
Using the Docker Client

    Flow:
        # P1 run cli command 
        docker run hello-world
            # |-> Starts Docker Client (CLI)
                # |-> After successfully starting Docker Client communicates commands to Docker Server
                    # |-> Docker Server checks Image Cache for hello-world container
                        # |-> If image does not exist, Docker Server connects to Docker Hub 
                            # Docker Hub is a repository of free Docker Images


What's a Container? 

    Hypothetically, if 2 (A & B) programs need different versions of the same dependency to run correctly,
    and we are constrained to installing a single version only, it follows that only one of the 2 afore 
    mentioned programs can run locally.

    We can resolve the dependency issue by fragmenting (name spacing) our hard drive, such that specific
    memory addresses are dedicated to storing each of the required dependency version.

    When program A or B make a call, the kernel will need to figure out which process the call is coming from
    and read from the correct fragment.

    Namespacing:
        Isolate resource per group of processes (can be used to restrict access to Network, communications to 
        other processes, etc.)

    Control Groups (cgroups):
        Unlike namespacing, control groups are used to restrict the amount of resources a process group can use.
        (Restrict memory, cpu usage, i/o, bandwidth)
    
    Docker Container:
        Combines concept of namespacing and control grouping
        A container is a running process along with a subset of physical resources allocated to the same.
        An Image is a snapshot of the file system required to run the process, along with a StartUp Command

Docker CLI commands

    # Alias docker
    docker
        |-> References to the docker client

    # Flag run
    docker run
            |-> Attempt to create and start a container process
    
    # Flag image 
    docker run <image-name>
                    |-> Name of the image to use for this container
