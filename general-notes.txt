Why use Docker?

Docker attempts to solve problem where by errors appear during software installation.

    For example, npm packages requiring certain node version etc. 

    Docker in a nut shell:
        On mac redis installation guide does not work simply by copy pasting https://redis.io/downloadc copy
            docker run -it redis on the other hand installs redis 

Takeaway: 
    Docker makes it really easy to install and run software without worrying about setup or dependencies.

What is Docker? 
    Docker is a platform containing a number of apps/tools(Docker Client, Server, Machine, Images, Hub, Compose)
     in its ecosystem for creating and running containers.

    Image:
        Single file with all the dependencies and configurations required to run a program.

    Container:
        An instance of an image (runs a program).

    When we ran 'docker run -it redis' the Docker CLI, reached out the Docker Hub and downloaded an image.

Docker for Mac/Windows:
    Docker Client:
        Also known as Docker Command Line Interface(CLI), is a tool we are going to use to issue commands to.

    Docker Server:
        Also known as a Docker Daemon, is a tool responsible for creating images, running containers, etc.

Mac OSX:
    1. Need to sign up for an account.
    2. Download docker for mac
    3. Docker ID publicly visible, install and login to Docker
        verify installation with docker version

    Windows has a similar installation guide.

    https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#prerequisites

        On all linux oss' must uninstall older versions of Docker
        
        For Ubuntu (which is what I am using)

            sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc

        Community package is now called docker-ce

            terminal installation commands:

                # Step 1
                sudo apt-get update
                
                # Step 2
                sudo apt-get install \
                apt-transport-https \
                ca-certificates \
                curl \
                gnupg-agent \
                software-properties-common

                # Step 3
                curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

                # Step 3
                sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88

                # Step 4 (bionic, x86_64)
                sudo add-apt-repository \
                "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
                $(lsb_release -cs) \
                stable"

                # Step 5
                sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

                # Step 6 verify installation
                sudo docker run hello-world

            next we need to install Docker Compose
                https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose

                # Step 1
                sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

                # Step 2
                sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

                # Step 3 verify installation
                docker-compose --version

            running docker without sudo
                https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user
                
                # Step 1
                sudo groupadd docker

                # Step 2 
                sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

                # Step 3
                newgrp docker 

                # Step 4 verify docker runs without sudo
                docker run hello-world
